# Finding Donors For *CharityML*

This study corresponds to the second project of the nanodegree *Machine Learning Engineer*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to provide a machine learning model able to help *CharityML* (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to its cause, based on a modified version of the 1994 U.S. Census dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income): This modified 1994 U.S. Census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features, and one target variable.

In this repository, you will find the following files:
* The file ***finding-donors-for-charityml.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file ***visuals.py***, a Python file which contains functions allowing to visualize specific results obtained during the study;
* The file ***census.csv***, the modified 1994 U.S. Census dataset used for this study.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the machine learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **Scikit-Learn** (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a very popular and complete machine learning framework.
